# Title  
A Consciousness‑First, Multidimensional Model of Reality  
*(A living document: open for critique & falsification)*

---

## 1. Abstract  
A 150‑word summary of the model, its key claims, and its scope.

---

## 2. Background & Motivation  
- Why does materialism fall short?  
- What open questions in biology, physics, and consciousness lead to this model?

---

## 3. Core Hypotheses  
1. **Consciousness provides the collapse mechanism** in quantum events.  
2. **Seven parallel frequency‑layers** map to chakra‑like realities.  
3. **Higher‑self orchestration** enables cross‑layer healing phenomena.  
4. **Observation is required** for matter to resolve in any layer.

---

## 4. Testable Predictions & Falsification Criteria  
For each hypothesis, list:
- **Predictions** (what you expect to observe).  
- **Possible refutations** (what outcome would disprove it).  
- **Proposed experiments** or observational studies.

| Hypothesis | Prediction | Falsifier | Experiment / Data to Collect |
|------------|------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| Conscious collapse | Unobserved quantum system remains indefinite | Wave‑function collapses w/o observer | Delayed‑choice variant with non‑conscious detectors |
| Layered realities | Shared traumatic‑event echoes across subjects | No cross‑reality echo ever found | Statistical study of identical rare injuries in matched cohorts |
| …          | …          | …         | …                            |

---

## 5. Methods & Data  
- **Data sources** (clinical case studies, quantum optics labs, surveys of NDE survivors, etc.)  
- **Analytical frameworks** (statistical tests, phenomenological coding, signal‑processing for “miracle” recovery data).

---

## 6. Open Questions & Future Work  
- Gaps in the model.  
- Next‑gen experiments you can’t do alone (invite collaborators).  

---

## 7. References  
A brief bibliography of the most critical sources you’ve patch‑tested against.

## 8. How to Contribute  
1. Fork this repo / project.  
2. Edit the section you question or expand.  
3. Submit a Pull Request or Issue—clearly state your counter‑evidence or proposed test.  
4. We’ll discuss and either merge, revise, or close with reason.

---

## 9. Code of Conduct  
We critique ideas, not people. All feedback must be evidence‑based and civil.

> **Ready to launch?**  
> 1. Create a new repository on GitHub (public, open issues/pull requests).  
> 2. Paste in this README.md template.  
> 3. Fill in your current text, hypotheses, and any initial predictions you’ve sketched.  
> 4. Share the link with your network, on forums, or via academic mailing lists.

From here, you’ll have a **living, community‑driven** test bed for your ideas—exactly the kind of falsification‑friendly environment you’re after.
